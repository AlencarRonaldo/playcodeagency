Mario Theme Music Files

To add the Mario theme music:

1. Download a royalty-free 8-bit music file or create your own
2. Name it "mario-theme.mp3" 
3. Place it in this directory (/public/sounds/music/)

Legal alternatives:
- Create your own 8-bit composition inspired by classic gaming
- Use royalty-free chiptune music from:
  - freesound.org
  - opengameart.org
  - cc0music.com

The system will fallback to Web Audio API synthesis if no file is found.
